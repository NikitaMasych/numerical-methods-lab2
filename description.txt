It is necessary to implement three methods of solving a system of linear algebraic equations:
1. Gauss method.
i. You need to implement not in the form of "naive
method of excluding variables", and in matrix form (LU decomposition),
necessarily with the selection of the main element.
2. The sweep method for a tridiagonal matrix
3. Jacobi method.
4. Seidel's method.

The program should allow the user to explore the behavior of methods on
matrices of two types - a random matrix and a Hilbert matrix
• At the same time, it is necessary to be able to generate the corresponding arbitrary matrix
dimensions (you can consider the maximum size 1000x1000)
• When generating a random matrix for methods 2, 3 and 4, it must be modified so that
the condition of convergence is fulfilled. The Hilbert matrix does not need to be modified -
we do not test the running method on it, the Jacobi method probably will not match. Method
Seidel - maybe it will coincide.
